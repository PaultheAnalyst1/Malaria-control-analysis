# Malaria-control-analysis

 Project Overview:

This project analyzes the effectiveness of malaria control data using Python for data cleaning and statistical analysis, and Excel for interactive dashboards.

The goal is to identify the impacts of interventions to support effective malaria control strategies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

**Python:** pandas, matplotlib, numpy, statsmodels, Factoranalyzer, seaborn, and more.

**Excel:** Pivot tables, slicers, conditional formatting, interactive charts

**Jupyter Notebook:** Exploratory analysis and visualizations

## üìä Analysis Pipeline

* Data Cleaning and Modelling:
 I used Microsoft Excel for the data cleaning. I also performed data modelling and visualization for Objective 1 and the Likert scale for Objective 3.

* Statistical Analysis: I used Python libraries for the bulk of the statistical analysis

*Data visualization: I used Microsoft Excel to create the interactive dashboard.

*Reporting: I compiled the breakdown of the statistical analysis in a PDF document.
